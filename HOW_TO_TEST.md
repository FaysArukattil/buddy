# 🧪 How to Test Auto Transaction Detection

## ✅ CRASH FIXED!

The app crash issue has been fixed. The problem was:
1. **Manual service declaration** in AndroidManifest.xml (removed - package handles it automatically)
2. **Aggressive permission request** on app start (changed to passive initialization)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### Step 1: Rebuild and Install
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Step 2: Add Test Widget (Temporary)

Add this test helper to your Profile screen to easily test notifications:

**In `lib/views/screens/bottomnavbarscreen/profile_screen.dart`:**

1. Add import at the top:
```dart
import 'package:buddy/utils/notification_test_helper.dart';
```

2. Add the test widget in the build method, right after the "Auto Transaction Detection" section:

```dart
// Around line 1030, after the Auto-Detection settings
const SizedBox(height: 20),

// TEST HELPER - Remove this before Play Store release
const NotificationTestHelper(),

const SizedBox(height: 30),
```

### Step 3: Test Without Real Notifications

1. **Run the app**
2. **Go to Profile screen**
3. **Scroll down** to see the blue "Test Notifications" box
4. **Tap any test button:**
   - "Debit ₹500" - Tests expense transaction
   - "Credit ₹2000" - Tests income transaction
   - "Food ₹450" - Tests food category
   - "Shopping ₹1250" - Tests shopping category
   - "Transport ₹300" - Tests transport category

5. **Check Home screen** - Transaction should appear immediately!

## 📱 Testing Real Notifications

### Method 1: SMS Testing (Most Realistic)

Send these SMS messages to your device from another phone:

**Test 1: Simple Debit**
```
Your A/C 1234 debited by Rs.500 for shopping
```

**Test 2: Credit Transaction**
```
Your A/C 5678 credited with Rs.2000 via UPI
```

**Test 3: Food (Swiggy)**
```
Payment of Rs.450 to Swiggy successful
```

**Test 4: Shopping (Amazon)**
```
Rs.1,250 debited for Amazon purchase
```

**Test 5: Transport (Uber)**
```
Rs.300 paid to Uber for ride
```

### Method 2: Wait for Real Transactions

The most authentic test:
1. Enable auto-detection
2. Make a real UPI payment or receive bank SMS
3. Check if transaction appears automatically

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Enable Auto-Detection:

1. **Open Buddy app**
2. **Go to Profile tab** (bottom navigation)
3. **Scroll to "Auto Transaction Detection"**
4. **Tap "Notification Permission"**
5. **In Android settings, find and enable "Buddy"**
6. **Return to app**
7. **Toggle "Auto-Detect Transactions" to ON**

---

## 📊 What to Check

### ✅ Success Indicators:

1. **Test widget works:**
   - Tap test buttons
   - Transactions appear in Home screen
   - Correct amounts and categories

2. **Real SMS works:**
   - Send test SMS
   - Transaction appears within 2-3 seconds
   - Category is auto-assigned

3. **Duplicate prevention:**
   - Send same SMS twice
   - Only ONE transaction created

4. **Logs show activity:**
   ```
   ✅ MAIN: Database initialized
   ✅ MAIN: Notification service initialized
   📬 NOTIFICATION: Received from...
   ✅ NOTIFICATION: Auto-transaction added successfully!
   ```

### ❌ Issues to Watch For:

1. **App crashes** - Should be fixed now
2. **No transactions appear** - Check permission and toggle
3. **Wrong amounts** - Check parsing logic
4. **Wrong categories** - Check keyword matching
5. **Duplicates created** - Check hash generation

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### Check Logs:
```bash
flutter logs | findstr NOTIFICATION
```

### Expected Log Flow:
```
✅ MAIN: Database initialized
✅ MAIN: Notification service initialized
🎧 NOTIFICATION: Starting notification listener...
✅ NOTIFICATION: Listener started successfully
📬 NOTIFICATION: Received from com.google.android.apps.messaging
   Title: Bank Alert
   Content: Your A/C debited by Rs.500
🤖 DATABASE: Auto-inserting transaction: expense ₹500.0
✅ DATABASE: Auto-transaction saved with ID: 1
✅ NOTIFICATION: Auto-transaction added successfully!
```

### If No Logs Appear:
1. Check permission is granted
2. Check toggle is ON
3. Restart app
4. Check Android notification settings

## 🎨 Test Widget Features

The `NotificationTestHelper` widget provides:

- **5 test buttons** for different scenarios
- **Instant feedback** with snackbar messages
- **Direct database insertion** (bypasses notification system)
- **Same parsing logic** as real notifications
- **Easy to use** - just tap and check

### Remove Before Release:

**Important:** Remove the test widget before publishing to Play Store:

1. Remove import:
```dart
// Remove this line
import 'package:buddy/utils/notification_test_helper.dart';
```

2. Remove widget:
```dart
// Remove this widget
const NotificationTestHelper(),
```

## 📈 Performance Testing

### Battery Usage:
- Monitor battery drain over 24 hours
- Should be minimal (event-driven, not polling)

### Memory Usage:
- Check in Android Studio Profiler
- Should remain stable

### Response Time:
- Transaction should appear within 1-2 seconds
- Check logs for timing

---
