# üîî Notification Access Permission - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

### **Issue:**
- Confusion between **Notification Access** (to READ notifications) and **POST_NOTIFICATIONS** (to SHOW notifications)
- We need **Notification Access** to read SMS/UPI notifications from other apps

### **Solution:**
‚úÖ **Removed POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission**  
‚úÖ **Kept BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE** (correct one)  
‚úÖ **Updated dialog text to be crystal clear**  
‚úÖ **Added specific instructions**

## üîç Understanding the Permissions

### **Two Different Permissions:**

#### **1. POST_NOTIFICATIONS** ‚ùå (NOT what we need)
- **Purpose:** Show notifications TO the user
- **Example:** "You have a new message"
- **Settings:** Apps ‚Üí Buddy ‚Üí Notifications
- **We DON'T need this**

#### **2. BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE** ‚úÖ (What we need)
- **Purpose:** READ notifications FROM other apps
- **Example:** Read SMS from bank, UPI apps
- **Settings:** Settings ‚Üí Notification Access ‚Üí Buddy
- **We NEED this**

---

## üì± Where to Find It

### **Notification Access Settings:**

**Path 1:**
```
Settings ‚Üí Apps & notifications ‚Üí Special app access ‚Üí Notification access ‚Üí Buddy
```

**Path 2:**
```

## üéØ What We Changed

```

**After:**
```xml
<!-- Permission to read notifications from other apps (Notification Listener) -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE" />

## üîß Technical Details

### **Permission Declaration:**
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE" />
```

**What it does:**
- Allows app to bind to NotificationListenerService
- Enables reading notifications from other apps
- Requires user to manually enable in Settings
- Cannot be granted programmatically (security feature)

### **How We Request It:**
```dart
await NotificationListenerService.requestPermission();
```

**What it does:**
- Opens Android Settings
- Navigates to Notification Access page
- User must manually toggle the app ON
- Returns to app after user action

### **How We Check It:**
```dart
final isGranted = await NotificationListenerService.isPermissionGranted();
```

**Returns:**

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **"Buddy" Not in List:**

**Possible Causes:**
1. App not properly installed
2. Package not registered
3. Need to rebuild app

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Complete clean rebuild
flutter clean
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### **Permission Not Working:**

**Check:**
1. Is "Buddy" toggled ON in Notification Access?
2. Did you rebuild after adding permission?
3. Is notification_listener_service package installed?

**Verify:**
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
# Check Settings ‚Üí Notification Access
```

### **Dialog Not Showing:**

**Reasons:**
1. Already asked once (uses SharedPreferences)
2. Permission already granted
3. Delay not completed (1 second)

**Test:**
```bash
# Clear app data
adb shell pm clear com.example.buddy
# Or uninstall and reinstall
```
