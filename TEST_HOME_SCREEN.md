## üö® COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: Balance shows ‚Çπ0
**Solution:**
- Check console: "Retrieved X transactions"
- If X = 0, database is empty
- Add transactions first
- If X > 0 but balance = 0, check console for calculation errors

### Issue 2: Not all transactions showing
**Solution:**
- Check console: "_transactions.length = X"
- Should match "Retrieved X transactions"
- If different, share console output

### Issue 3: Values don't match Profile
**Solution:**
- Do FULL RESTART (not hot reload)
- Check console for both Home and Profile calculations
- Share screenshots of both screens

### Issue 4: "read-only" error
**Solution:**
- This should be fixed
- If still happening, share full console output
- May need to clear app data
