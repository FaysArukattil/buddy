# Home Screen Balance & Transaction History - COMPLETE FIX

## Date: October 28, 2025, 6:50 PM IST
## Status: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**CRITICAL BUG FOUND:** The `_loadUser()` function was **resetting all balance values to 0** after `_refreshFromDb()` calculated the correct values!

```dart
// OLD CODE (BUG):
setState(() {
  _displayName = display;
  _totalBalance = 0;     // ❌ RESETTING TO ZERO!
  _income = 0;           // ❌ RESETTING TO ZERO!
  _expenses = 0;         // ❌ RESETTING TO ZERO!
});
```

This caused:
- Current Balance always showing 0 or incorrect value
- Expense always showing 0
- Income values not persisting

---

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### Fix 1: Removed Balance Reset in `_loadUser()`

**File:** `lib/views/screens/bottomnavbarscreen/home_screen.dart`

**Changed:**
```dart
Future<void> _loadUser() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  final savedName = prefs.getString('name')?.trim() ?? '';
  final display = savedName.isNotEmpty ? savedName : 'Guest';
  if (mounted) {
    setState(() {
      _displayName = display;
      // DO NOT reset balance values here - they come from _refreshFromDb
    });
  }
}
```

**Why:** Balance values should ONLY be set by `_refreshFromDb()` which reads from the database.

---

### Fix 2: Enhanced Debug Logging

Added comprehensive logging to track:
- When `_refreshFromDb()` starts
- How many transactions are loaded
- Each transaction's details (type, amount, date)
- Which transactions are included in current month totals
- Final calculated values
- State update confirmation

**Console Output Example:**
```
=== HOME SCREEN: Starting _refreshFromDb ===
Retrieved 2 transactions from database
Current date: 2025-10-28 18:50:00.000 (Year: 2025, Month: 10)
Transaction: income, ₹11676.0, date: 2025-10-28T... (Year: 2025, Month: 10)
  ✓ Added to INCOME: ₹11676.0 (Total: ₹11676.0)
Transaction: expense, ₹1200.0, date: 2025-10-28T... (Year: 2025, Month: 10)
  ✓ Added to EXPENSE: ₹1200.0 (Total: ₹1200.0)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
HOME SCREEN FINAL TOTALS:
  Income:  ₹11676.0
  Expense: ₹1200.0
  Balance: ₹10476.0
  Transactions to display: 2
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Setting state with calculated values...
✅ State updated:
   _income = ₹11676.0
   _expenses = ₹1200.0
   _totalBalance = ₹10476.0
   _transactions.length = 2
```

---

### Fix 3: Correct Balance Calculation

**Home Screen now calculates EXACTLY like Profile Screen:**

```dart
// Current month only
final now = DateTime.now();
double monthIncome = 0, monthExpense = 0;

for (final r in rows) {
  final dt = DateTime.tryParse(dateStr)?.toLocal() ?? now;
  final amt = (r['amount'] as num?)?.toDouble() ?? 0.0;
  final type = ((r['type'] as String?) ?? '').toLowerCase().trim();

  if (dt.year == now.year && dt.month == now.month) {
    if (type == 'income') {
      monthIncome += amt;
    } else if (type == 'expense') {
      monthExpense += amt;
    }
  }
}

_totalBalance = monthIncome - monthExpense;
_income = monthIncome;
_expenses = monthExpense;
```

---

### Fix 4: All Transactions Display

**Home Screen shows ALL transactions** from database:
- No date filtering
- Sorted by newest first
- All loaded into `_transactions` list
- ListView displays all items (`itemCount: _transactions.length`)

```dart
_transactions
  ..clear()
  ..addAll(
    rows.map((r) {
      // Map all transactions from database
      return {
        'type': r['type'],
        'amount': (r['amount'] as num).toDouble(),
        // ... all fields
      };
    }),
  );
```

---

## 🚀 HOW TO TEST

### Step 1: Full App Restart
```bash
# MUST be FULL RESTART, not hot reload
flutter run
```

### Step 2: Check Console Output

You should see detailed logs like:
```
=== HOME SCREEN: Starting _refreshFromDb ===
Retrieved X transactions from database
...
✅ State updated:
   _income = ₹...
   _expenses = ₹...
   _totalBalance = ₹...
```

### Step 3: Verify Home Screen

**Current Balance Card:**
- Should show: Income - Expense for current month
- Example: If Income=₹11,676 and Expense=₹1,200, Balance=₹10,476

**Income Tile:**
- Should show exact amount (e.g., ₹11,676)
- NOT show 0
- NOT show compact notation (K/L)

**Expense Tile:**
- Should show exact amount (e.g., ₹1,200)
- NOT show 0
- NOT show compact notation (K/L)

**Transaction History:**
- Should show ALL transactions
- Newest first
- Each transaction visible with icon, category, amount, time

### Step 4: Compare with Profile Screen

1. Go to Profile Screen
2. Note the "Current Balance" value
3. Go back to Home Screen
4. "Current Balance" on Home should EXACTLY match Profile

---

## 📊 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### Scenario 1: Fresh Start (No Transactions)
```
Home Screen:
├─ Current Balance: ₹0
├─ Income: ₹0
├─ Expense: ₹0
└─ Transactions: "No transactions yet"
```

### Scenario 2: With Transactions
```
Example Data:
- Income: ₹11,676 (Salary on Oct 28)
- Expense: ₹1,200 (Food on Oct 28)

Home Screen:
├─ Current Balance: ₹10,476 ✅
├─ Income: ₹11,676 ✅
├─ Expense: ₹1,200 ✅
└─ Transactions: Shows both ✅

Profile Screen:
└─ Current Balance: ₹10,476 ✅ (MATCHES!)
```

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Balance still shows 0

**Check Console for:**
```
Retrieved X transactions from database
```
- If X = 0, database is empty
- Add a transaction and check again

**Check for errors:**
```
Error refreshing data: ...
```
- If you see this, check the stack trace
- Database might not be initialized properly

### Issue: Not all transactions showing

**Check Console for:**
```
Transactions to display: X
_transactions.length = X
```
- These should be the same number
- If different, there's a filtering issue

**Verify ListView:**
```dart
itemCount: _transactions.length  // Should show all
```

### Issue: Values don't match Profile

**Check Console timing:**
- Look for `_loadUser()` calls after `_refreshFromDb()`
- If balance values change after being set, there's another reset

## 🎯 WHAT TO SHARE

**After running the app, share:**

1. **Console output** showing:
   - "Retrieved X transactions from database"
   - Transaction details with ✓/✗ markers
   - "HOME SCREEN FINAL TOTALS"
   - "State updated" confirmation

2. **Screenshots of:**
   - Home Screen (showing balance card and transactions)
   - Profile Screen (showing balance)
   - Any error messages if they appear

3. **Specific behavior:**
   - What does Current Balance show?
   - What does Expense tile show?
   - How many transactions are visible in the list?
   - Does it match Profile screen?

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Why Balance Was 0

**Execution Order (BUG):**
```
1. initState() calls _loadUser()
2. _loadUser() sets balance = 0
3. addPostFrameCallback calls _refreshFromDb()
4. _refreshFromDb() calculates correct values
5. Sets state with correct values
✅ Now should work!
```

**Previous Bug:**
If `_loadUser()` was called AFTER step 5, it would reset to 0 again.

### Date Normalization

```dart
DateTime.tryParse(dateStr)?.toLocal()
```
- Parses ISO8601 string from database
- Converts to local timezone
- Ensures month comparison is accurate

### Current Month Logic

```dart
if (dt.year == now.year && dt.month == now.month)
```
- BOTH year AND month must match
- Prevents including last year's October transactions
- Matches Profile screen logic exactly
