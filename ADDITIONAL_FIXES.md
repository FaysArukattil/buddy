# Additional Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Home Screen Not Updating After Adding Transaction
**Problem:** When adding a transaction via the FAB, the home screen containers (balance, income, expense) were not updating until navigating to another screen and back.

**Solution:**
- Made `HomeScreenState` public (removed underscore prefix)
- Added `GlobalKey<HomeScreenState>` in `BottomNavbarScreen` to access home screen state
- Modified FAB's `onTap` to call `_homeKey.currentState?.refreshData()` after transaction is added
- Removed `didChangeDependencies` which was causing excessive refreshes
- Home screen now updates **instantly** when you add or edit a transaction

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/views/screens/bottomnavbarscreen/home_screen.dart`
- `lib/views/screens/bottomnavbarscreen/bottom_navbar_screen.dart`

### 2. ✅ Smart Currency Formatting (Show Full Amounts with Decimals Only When Needed)
**Problem:** All values were being rounded to integers, losing decimal precision. User wanted to see decimals when they exist, but not show unnecessary ".00"

**Solution:**
- Updated `FormatUtils.formatCurrencyFull()` to intelligently handle decimals:
  - If value is whole number (e.g., 1500): Shows `₹1,500` (no decimals)
  - If value has decimals (e.g., 1500.50): Shows `₹1,500.5` (removes trailing zeros)
  - If value has full decimals (e.g., 1500.75): Shows `₹1,500.75`
- Uses Indian number formatting with commas (₹1,50,000 instead of ₹150,000)
- Compact mode still works for lists: `₹1.5K`, `₹2.3L`, `₹5.0Cr`
- Full amounts shown in detail views and statistics

**Examples:**
- `₹500` (not ₹500.00)
- `₹1,234.5` (not ₹1,234.50)
- `₹12,345.67`
- `₹1,50,000` (Indian formatting)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/utils/format_utils.dart`

### 3. ✅ Statistics Chart Fixed - No More Overlapping
**Problem:** 
- Day view showed 24 dots (one per hour) - too crowded
- Month view showed 28-31 dots (one per day) - overlapping
- Year view showed months but labels were unclear
- Money values on Y-axis were missing

**Solution:**

#### **Dot Display Logic:**
- **Day View:** Shows every 4th hour (6 dots: 0:00, 4:00, 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00)
- **Week View:** Shows all 7 days (Mon-Sun)
- **Month View:** Shows every 5th day + last day (6-7 dots: 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
- **Year View:** Shows every 2nd month (6 dots: Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep, Nov)
- Only shows dots for non-zero values
- Smaller dot size (3.5px radius) for cleaner look

#### **X-Axis Labels:**
- Same intervals as dots to avoid crowding
- Clear, readable labels at appropriate intervals
- No overlapping text

#### **Y-Axis (Money Values):**
- Added left axis showing money amounts
- Uses compact format (₹1K, ₹5K, ₹10K, etc.)
- Small font (9px) to save space
- Reserved 50px width for labels

#### **Total Display:**
- Shows full formatted amount (not compact)
- Example: `₹12,345.67` instead of `₹12.3K`
- Proper overflow handling with ellipsis
- Right-aligned for better readability

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/views/screens/bottomnavbarscreen/statistics_screen.dart`

## Technical Details

### Currency Formatting Logic
```dart
// Compact mode (for lists)
₹10,000+ → ₹10K
₹1,00,000+ → ₹1L
₹1,00,00,000+ → ₹1Cr

// Full mode (for details)
₹1500 → ₹1,500
₹1500.50 → ₹1,500.5
₹1500.75 → ₹1,500.75
```

### Chart Dot Intervals
```
Day (24 hours):    Every 4 hours  = 6 dots max
Week (7 days):     Every day      = 7 dots
Month (28-31 days): Every 5 days  = 6-7 dots
Year (12 months):  Every 2 months = 6 dots
```

### Home Screen Refresh Flow
```
1. User taps FAB
2. Add Transaction modal opens
3. User saves transaction
4. Modal returns true
5. BottomNavbarScreen calls _homeKey.currentState?.refreshData()
6. HomeScreen._refreshFromDb() executes
7. UI updates instantly with new values
```

2. **Clean Numbers:** Decimals only when needed, not cluttering with .00
3. **Readable Charts:** Clear intervals, no overlapping, easy to understand
4. **Professional Look:** Indian number formatting, proper money display
